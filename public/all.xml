			<description><![CDATA[<p>I’m still in the process of <a href="https://robertbirming.com/headsup-break-reader/">moving my old blog posts</a> over here. I wouldn’t say it’s boring — it’s suuuper booooring.</p>
<p>So I decided to take a break and do something more fun. From my never-ending “ideas for the future” list, I picked <em>Bear photo gallery</em>. It’s made with my <a href="https://robertbirming.com/bearly/">Bearly theme</a> in mind, but it should work well with plenty of other themes too.</p>
<p>The gallery itself works without any scripting, so anyone can use it. If you want the lightbox effect, where you can click and browse images in a larger view, you’ll need a Bear subscription since that part relies on a footer script.</p>
<div data-sanitized-class="bearly-gallery">
<ul>
<li><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/robert/img_7941-1.webp" alt="Stockholm"></li>
<li><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/birming/img_6081.webp" alt="Lidingö"></li>
<li><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/robert/img_5754.webp" alt="Stockholm"></li>
<li><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/birming/img_0355.webp" alt="Autumn"></li>
<li><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/robert/img_5551.webp" alt="Lake"></li>
<li><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/birming/20190211_131851.webp" alt="Typewriter"></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the demo above, you can navigate the images using your <strong>keyboard</strong> or your <strong>mouse/touch</strong>. If you add the lightbox script to your own blog, it will work the same way there too:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Click</strong> an image to open it</li>
<li><strong>Click right side</strong> of the screen to go to the <strong>next</strong> image</li>
<li><strong>Click left side</strong> to go to the <strong>previous</strong> image</li>
<li><strong>Arrow keys</strong> also work: <code>←</code> and <code>→</code> (<code>A</code> and <code>D</code> work too)</li>
<li>Press <strong>Escape</strong> to close the gallery</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also adjust the <strong>image ratio</strong> in the CSS if you prefer a different look. Just change the <code>aspect-ratio</code> value, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aspect-ratio: 4 / 3</code> for a classic photo ratio (default)</li>
<li><code>aspect-ratio: 1 / 1</code> for square photos</li>
<li><code>aspect-ratio: 3 / 2</code> for a camera-style format</li>
<li><code>aspect-ratio: 16 / 9</code> for a wider, cinematic feel</li>
</ul>

			<title>PTPL 182 · Why I Keep HTML Email in My Plain Text Life</title>
			<link>https://ellanew.com/2025/11/17/ptpl-182-why-keep-html-email-not-plain-text</link>
						<description><![CDATA[<h2 data-sanitized-id="some-information-only-makes-sense-when-formatted">Some information only makes sense when formatted</h2>
<p><a href="https://ellanew.com/2025/10/06/ptpl-176-simple-obsidian-iphone-shortcuts" title="wikilink">I mostly run my life in plain text</a>, so I was initially excited to hear about plain text email. One email into the experiment, however, I was out!</p>
<p>As much as I love the idea of a fully plain text life, I’ve decided that naked email is, for me, a step too far. I deal with customers who like pretty links, images, and formatting in the emails I send them. I appreciate images and formatting in (most of) the emails I receive.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-id="are-html-emails-dangerous">Are <span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails dangerous?</h3>
<p><span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails can contain tracking pixels, and spoofed links.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://useplaintext.email/">Use Plain Text Email</a> website says—</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails are mainly used for marketing - that is, emails you probably don’t want to see in the first place. The few advantages they offer for end-users, such as links, inline images, and bold or italic text, aren’t worth the trade-off. —<a href="https://useplaintext.email/#why-plaintext">why plain text</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails I receive are, for the most part, those I’ve signed up to. Their links and images can be helpful. Some are marketing messages I’ve agreed to receive. Others, like the example below, are order confirmations with useful reference information, including images.</p>
<p>It is true that, in some cases,<span data-sanitized-class="push-double"></span> <span data-sanitized-class="pull-double">“</span><a href="https://useplaintext.email/#why-plaintext:~:text=Privacy%20invasion%20and%20tracking"><span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails are good for marketers and bad for you</a><span data-sanitized-class="push-double"></span><span data-sanitized-class="pull-double">”</span>. Receiving emails in plain text would unmask any nefarious links hiding behind convincing graphics. But you would still need to know what you are looking for, in order to recognise links that point to bogus websites. This isn’t something your grandma is necessarily going to know how to do without some guidance.</p>
<p>Here’s an order confirmation email I received this week, in both <span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> and plain text formats:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.blot.im/blog_177bc256f0ee469c998e912e20ece048/_image_cache/51ad1396-819a-42cc-8a48-36b2389cbbea.png" alt="Two side by side screenshots of a MooGoo order, showing one in rich text and the other in plain text. The rich text version has an Order Confirmation graphic at the top, and a View Order Status button at the bottom. The plain text version has lines of monospaced text, with a partially obscured, extremely long URL beneath the words “View Order Status”." width="2930" height="1624"></p>
<p>I like seeing thumbnails of the products I’ve purchased (visible when scrolling down the <span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> version), and it’s good to have clear links I can go to in case of a problem with the order. The portion of the text you can see above (right) is just a snippet of a much longer message that contained all sorts of goobledegook. Some <span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails viewed as text can be very messy.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the potential security issues of <span data-sanitized-class="small-caps">HTML</span> emails are a real thing. These are the rules I follow in order to mitigate the risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off auto-loading of images</li>
<li>Actively maintain a suspicious mindset!</li>
<li>View individual emails as text as needed to verify the source</li>
<li>Don’t click on <em>any</em> link inside an unverified email</li>
<li>Never log into a site by clicking on a link within an email; always go directly to the website in the usual manner to login</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-sanitized-id="what-now">What now?</h3>
<p>I will always advocate for your most important information being stored in plain text, no matter what else you do with it. You won’t be able to change my mind on that one.</p>
<p>Looking into the two main email formats has made it clear that despite its advantages, plain text is not the best choice for every person, in every situation.</p>
<p>I recommend getting familiar with your email client’s settings, and change as needed. You could send yourself a few emails with the different types of quoted text and see which style you prefer.</p>

			<title>about the goldfish pond in the basement</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It has started to freeze in Baltimore and my goldfish pond needed to come inside. Adjusting to living with seasons after 15 years in Florida has been a lot, and some things weren't really thought through. Fortunately, we have a basement. Before I get to the fish being in the basement, I realized I've never blogged about them before so here's a short recap about my goldfish keeping hobby.</p>
<p>Here's the pond, first set up on my Florida deck 3 years ago:
<img src="https://smallcypress.neocities.org/images/IMG_2275.jpeg" alt="img"></p>
<p>I had wanted them for years since I started keeping tanks again in 2020, but I didn't have the space - they need a ton of space and filtration. I picked up my first friend, a little "oranda" mutt, and my other fish came from a goldfish and koi convention in Orlando.</p>
<p>Florida raccoons are just built different, and despite some intense netting and screening I lost two beautiful orandas. Eventually I started covering it with wood at night, and the fish grazed down that vallisneria (grass-like plant in the water) while the water lilies grew like crazy.</p>
<p>When we moved, I had to send the big tank with the pods to Baltimore and my poor fish lived in a trash can with me for a couple weeks of constant water changes. I drove them up in a 3-day electric car sojourn up north, with two nights of sneaking my trash can full of fish into hotels with a filter and bubbler to plug in at night.</p>
<p><img src="https://smallcypress.neocities.org/images/IMG_5347.jpeg" alt="img"></p>
<p>We set them up in a pond in the front yard, which kind of stuck out in my neighborhood - we're not in Florida anymore and I felt like I brought a certain trashiness to my block, so I will probably set them up in the back yard in the spring.</p>
<p><img src="https://smallcypress.neocities.org/images/goldfish3.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>In the basement, I really didn't want water splashing and moisture/mold, so I moved the pitcher filter into the water and used it as a planter for the peace lily from my father-in-law's funeral. He would have adored this insane setup in my basement, and the wood the tall light is clamped on is from one of his woodworking projects. There is a more powerful filter still cranking with this big ugly hose, which I will probably switch out or try to hide somehow. The fish like to hide behind the plant and under the planter, and when you settle in for a movie (our TV is in the basement) they are always out and about eating algae.</p>
<p><img src="https://smallcypress.neocities.org/images/Untitled.jpeg" alt="img"></p>
<p>I am really happy with how I made it look for a temporary setup, and I am at the point in the fishkeeping hobby where I just have extra lights and filters and wood and extension cords and timers and cinderblocks lying around as to not have to spend anything. I was going to get a 125 gallon low-tech tank in this spot permanently, but I am pulling back on new projects to save aggressively for whatever stage of capitalist hell we're in now.</p>
<p>I have more information about this setup and some links about goldfish on <a href="https://smallcypress.neocities.org/pets">this webpage</a>, which is still under construction.</p>]]></description>

<blockquote><p>““When people say things like ‘Twitter is filled with fake news’ or ‘TikTok is ruining the attention spans of today’s youth,’” [Joe] Weisenthal writes, “all of that may be correct. But the bigger story, that more and more people are grappling with, is that a return to orality will fundamentally rewire the logic engine of the human brain.””</p></blockquote>
<p><span data-sanitized-id="more-31569"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>“For the first time in centuries, the elite no longer feel they need educated workers and soldiers to uphold and reproduce the system. […] The elites are ecstatic about imagining a vast, uneducated, and unproductive population forced to pay companies like OpenAI to access the written word and to approximate thought; with the unemployed illiterate and addicted to screens, they are unlikely to be politicized and join a socialist campaign.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://going-medieval.com/2025/10/21/on-ai-and-the-golem/">On AI and the golem</a> by Dr. Eleanor Janega</p>
<blockquote><p>I am thinking particularly of the ridiculous ass letter written and signed in 2023 by a few hundred AI bullshit artists, I mean, ‘experts’ about how AI poses an ‘existential threat to existence.’… This is essentially the same thing as the golem stories, because what they are attempting to do is position themselves as a sort of priestly class with access to forbidden, arcane knowledge that must be feared, respected, and obeyed.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>[C]onventional wisdom can be boiled down to “that’s what they say,” with the ‘“they” being perpetually undefined. Common sense is what you know to be “true.” […] It is very hard to resist conventional wisdom when you are given no sense of where this conventional wisdom comes from and when people with more authority and experience is telling you that this is what should be done.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It is fashionable among elites now to frame the majority of people as “NPCs,” or non-player characters, in the parlance of video games: unthinking, sheeplike, atomized automatons. But deny a vast multitude what they need for long enough and you’d be surprised at how many decide to play.</p></blockquote>

<p>I keep thinking that part of the problem of modern American society is that <strong>we have amply demonstrated our intellectual equality but are still denied economic equality</strong>. For now at least, we are well-educated — we know history, we know political theory, we know philosophy, we know economics — so what keeps us serfs <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/06/13/a-society-subservient-to-the-market/">under capitalism</a> is in part simply <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/04/24/access-to-capital-for-change/">lack of capital</a>. Despite the defunding and undermining of public education, we are the elite’s intellectual equals… yet they still think of us as their servants.</p>
<p>There is no justification for them to think themselves naturally superior; <strong>we have rejected the divine right of kings and predestined social roles… in theory</strong>. In practice, <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/19/american-origin-stories/">American elites</a> <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/10/03/tools-for-keeping-power-in-the-upper-class/">have always</a> <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/11/05/the-election-is-just-the-first-step-for-democracy/">restrained our democracy</a> from fulfilling the will of the people.</p>
<p>The tech elite dreams of themselves as <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/04/09/controlling-the-information-platforms-controlling-the-information/">rightful kings</a> of technofeudalist city-states. They are obsessed with IQ because they believe it demonstrates their superiority, and thus meritocracy justifies their claim to leadership. (They have to believe that <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/04/08/dumbness-is-emotional-not-intellectual/">intelligence is a fixed, quantifiable property</a>, not <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_108_feynman_revisited/">learned and developed</a> across domains like any other skill, or they would be forced to admit <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/01/30/the-siren-call-of-llms/">how much of a mistake it is</a> <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/11/01/decisions-are-the-foundation-of-art/">to pass off their thinking to the machine</a>, or that their business acumen does not make up for their <a href="https://x.com/JoyceCarolOates/status/1987269465013428557">stunted emotional intelligence</a>.)</p>
<p>And then these self-declared geniuses go on LinkedIn and post <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/02/generative-ai-and-the-business-borg-aesthetic/">genAI pablum</a> about Plato’s cave allegory and are disappointed when we’re not so impressed with their 101-level intellectual prowess that we <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/10/13/thirsting-after-oligarchs-gone-wild/">fall to our knees</a> and beg them to rule us 🙄 They cannot recognize how derivative their thinking is because they lack intellectual curiosity. But if they destroy our education system, discourage critical thinking, and deskill white-collar careers, maybe the uneducated will think they are smart, and they will finally receive the worship that they crave.</p>

<p><em>I will not allow anyone to walk in my mind with dirty feet. — Mahatma Gandhi</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of us spend a lot of time worrying about what other people think. I don't have immunity, or a remedy.</p>
<p>I am, by nature, a people-pleaser. While this isn't inherently bad, it has been the cause of a great deal of stress over the years, allowing others (and sometimes their dirty feet) to occupy space and time in my mind. The line between consideration for others and toxic concern for how they perceive us can be razor thin. I think most people want to be liked and considered with some degree of esteem. However, the reality is that as imperfect people, living in an imperfect world, there is nothing we can do that will keep everyone happy. So, that shouldn't be an aspiration.</p>
<p>While not completely free from this worry, as I've gotten older, this seems to be less of an issue for me. Maybe wisdom (doubtful). Ignorance (more likely). <em>Or, I've figured out whose opinions matter to me.</em></p>
<p>I'm not advocating for a flippant disregard for the thoughts and feelings of others. How we treat people -- friends, family members, colleagues, and strangers -- matters. However, it is wise to approach our interactions with reasonable expectations. Focus on what is within our control. The happiness of another person isn't on this list (but, kindness is).</p>
<p>Assume the best in others. Listen. Be thoughtful. Act with integrity. Accept responsibility for your words and actions. If necessary, apologize.</p>
<p>Then...move on without worry.</p>

			<title>The thing that libs don't realize about means testing</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>...is that it is insanely annoying!!</p>
<p>I am now signed up for unemployment insurance in the state of California. I spent a lot of time on the phone recently trying to submit and the correct my application for it. This is the first time I have been laid off in my life (I had a 15 year streak of dodging layoffs by leaving for a new job immediately before they occurred!) and therefore this is the first time I have been eligible for UI in any part of the US.</p>
<p>I've been against aggressive means-testing for a long time because it seems stupid, unfair, and a waste of energy to restrict our social safety net programs with massive bureaucratic surveillance programs. I knew from my friends that it is also unbelievably annoying; I now have that experience myself. It is actually more annoying than doing my taxes, which is crazy. (I'd assumed that it would be about <em>exactly</em> as annoying as doing my taxes.)</p>
<p>The forms are huge, the websites are oddly laid-out, and everything is written in the strangest, densest language possible. The phone trees are word puzzles - every verbal question they pose will have multiple long asides referring to possible exceptions, often listing out specific document names or federal programs. By the time the phone tree completes a question, I sometimes have a hard time remembering how the sentence began.</p>
<p>I had the experience of being manually marked as "unable or unwilling to work full time", which I needed to call and correct; the guy at the EDD office had no idea why I'd been marked that way and simply manually reversed it. This is when I learned that my ability or willingness to work within the CA unemployment insurance system is not something that I can attest to positively <em>myself,</em> as <em>the worker in question;</em> it's something that a stranger at the back of the EDD tech decides about me and <em>manually inputs</em> after reviewing my material.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was on the phone solving that and other problems for hours. Amazing!</p>
<p>That's the whole blog post today: means testing is <em>more</em> annoying than doing your taxes. In my experience, it was about exactly as annoying as getting challenged by health insurance. On a stress level, it is even comparable to the time that airport security tried to take all my diabetes equipment away from me, which was possibly the most terrifying and morally objectionable bureaucratic challenge I've navigated in my life. (I was, I think, sixteen.) That's it! That's the post!!</p>]]></description>
