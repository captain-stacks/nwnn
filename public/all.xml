<h2>Something that interested me this week</h2>
<p>This week was a weird one with Veteran's Day in the U.S. right in the middle of the week, but it was fun too to celebrate my wedding anniversary, see good friends, and hang out with my babies. My toddler is actually starting to play with our 6 month old, which is <em>very</em> exciting, even though it's mostly her pretending to cook while he's sitting there like a blob, but... still!</p>
<p>I also wrote and coded some stuff that isn't public yet, <em>but</em> if you wanna hang out with me on the internet, <a href="https://twitch.tv/cassidoo?utm_source=cassidoo&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=words-once-they-are-printed-have-a-life-of-their">I'm streaming again</a> on Thursdays!

						<description><![CDATA[<p>There’s something oddly comforting about a shell function that takes care of boring things for you.</p>
<p>This <code>venv()</code> helper does exactly that.</p>
<p>It checks whether you’re already in an environment, spins up a fresh one if needed, installs your dependencies, and activates it.</p>
<p>To use this <code>venv</code> function, you’ll need to add it to your shell’s configuration file. If you’re using zsh, add the following function to your ~/.zshrc file. If you’re using bash, add it to your ~/.bashrc instead.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to <code>source ~/.zshrc</code> or <code>source ~/.bashrc</code> later!</p>
<p>This requires <code>uv</code> to work</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Conversations with recruiters usually tend to go more or less like this:<br>
“Are you looking for data scientists?”<br>
“Indeed we are! Do you have a degree in data science?”<br>
“I have an equivalent degree and over 8 years of experience in data science.”<br>
“So what kind of degree do you have?”<br>
“I have a PhD in English linguistics, but methodically I worked with data during that time.”<br>
[at this point the recruiter’s face usually assumes a puzzled look] “…That… doesn’t really sound like what we need… we’re not looking for humanities scholars.”<br>
“While linguistics is indeed often grouped among the humanities, it’s also the natural science among humanities. Methodically, I worked as a data scientist during my PhD, collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing data (language data) for over 6 years. I worked with advanced statistical models and have expert knowledge of R.”<br>
[puzzled looks intensify]</p>
<p>Perhaps you can feel my pain. I’ve recently been on the lookout for a new job, and I’ve been coming to realize that my PhD, which is supposed to be this great achievement, and which probably truly is one of the hardest things I ever did in my life, seems to be worthless. It is more of a hindrance than a help in trying to find a job, because recruiters see me as both under- and overqualified. They don’t really recognize it as experience in data science (which it definitely is), but at the same time they shy away from hiring someone with a PhD because that seems overqualified and/or intimidating. At least that’s my impression, no recruiter ever actually gave me decent helpful feedback, despite asking.</p>
<p>This has been going on for a while, and I’ve become fairly disillusioned with the job market in the industry. It’s not only that they don’t seem to know what to do with a PhD, it’s also the whole… soullessness of it. Do you love managing and executing high-impact, cross-functional projects? Do you blossom when you ensure successful deliveries aligned with corporate goals? Does nothing make your heart beat like driving actionable outcomes in a high-pressure environment? In case your sarcasm detector is broken, here’s a PSA: that’s sarcasm. Nothing makes me feel more dead inside like reading those ridiculous buzzwords, full of utterly useless bullshit. It always makes me wonder if people actually believe what they’re saying? How can you be passionate about making the rich richer, and contributing to a ridiculously bloated economy where bullshitters like this earn tons of money, but real, hard work, is underpaid? Economics was always one of my most-hated subjects in school, so I’ll not dwell on that. But after about 2 years in the corporate world and some time of reading job listings, I realized that I don’t identify with all of this. I hate agile, I think KPIs are red herrings to keep your employees occupied, and I don’t see the purpose in half the things some of these job listings demand.</p>
<p>Coming from <a href="https://chaosworks.org/2023/phd-leavingacademia/">academia</a>, I think the public service is probably much better suited for me than the industry, because at least there I get a sense of doing something for the greater good. I can see a clear purpose in creating graphs and reports on population or crime statistics, and I’d be very interested to do that. But doing data analysis of how many things a company producing stuff sells? Very meh.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish I could work in a creative job and make the same amount of money I do now, but alas, that’s not our reality. I would enjoy being a seamstress or carpenter or something along those lines a lot. But I feel at present, it would not be the wisest career choice to start at zero, because that’s basically what I already did when I finished my PhD.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this whole situation has not been great for my mental health. Getting constant rejections and feeling like my biggest accomplishment is worthless just makes me feel worthless, and it’s hard to remember what I really accomplished. I had a discussion with a friend about this a while ago, who suggested to keep busy by taking a mini-job or volunteering. I looked into that, and I signed up to volunteer at the International English Library here in Düsseldorf, which is a pretty cool and unique library because it’s competently in English (unlike most other libraries), and it’s completely volunteer run.</p>
<p>I knew this library already since I moved here, because I used to spend a lot of time there studying Swedish about 17ish years ago. Then at some point I stopped going there because of a former relationship, and I also didn’t read as much while I was at university (I had to read too much for uni). Since then, the library moved to a new location, and coincidentally I was also looking for a new place to host a roleplaying-related event that I co-organize. So it seemed like the perfect place and the perfect opportunity to apply to volunteer there.</p>
<p>I’ve been volunteering there for a few months now, and I finally feel like my diverse and unconventional career path found a purpose. I’ve been doing a few desk shifts at the library, which is their standard procedure, but since then I’ve also been working on creating new print products such as brochures for them, wrapping books in protective cover, doing some data analysis, creating surveys, and altogether helping where I can. I really enjoy volunteering there, and I feel like I can contribute a lot of my skills. I wish I could do a lot more, but some things take time there, due to the nature of it being an entirely volunteer-run organization. Most of the regular volunteers there who do the majority of the work to keep the library running are retired British / Irish / Australian ladies, and I feel like that’s definitely what I would want to do if I retire as well.</p>
<p>It’s just a great feeling to contribute to this awesome space where people from allover the world can come together, find books to read, or just attend events that are hosted there. It also has the added benefit of being able to read books for free. After having <a href="https://chaosworks.org/2025/reading-slump/">some hiccups</a> in trying to find books I like to read, it’s definitely a relieve that I don’t always have to buy what I want to read anymore. I also already donated a few of my books that I will not read again to the library, making their sci-fi and fantasy collection more diverse. I’m happy I finally found something that make me feel useful, even though it probably won’t help me advance my <em>real</em> career so much…</p>]]></description>

			<title>Google will allow experienced users to install apps from third-party sources on Android</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Google has backtracked partially on its anti-third party app store policy. It will allow power users to install Android apps from alternative sources.</p>
<p>The Mountain View company had recently announced a system for <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/08/26/google-wants-android-app-developers-to-verify-their-identity-this-could-affect-sideloading-apps/" data-wpel-link="internal">Developer Verification</a>, that requires Android app developers who distribute their apps outside the Play Store to verify their identity by registering with Google. While it claimed this would protect users from malware apps, the policy was met with <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/09/29/f-droid-criticizes-googles-anti-sideloading-policy-calls-for-antitrust-scrutiny/" data-wpel-link="internal">widespread criticism</a> from the Android community. <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/10/31/f-droid-says-googles-statement-about-sideloading-is-not-going-away-is-false/" data-wpel-link="internal">F-Droid had warned</a> that this move could kill the openness of Android's ecosystem, bringing it totally under Google's control. And there's also the fact that the <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/11/07/google-play-store-hosted-239-malicious-apps-that-were-downloaded-40-million-times/" data-wpel-link="internal">Play Store has been prone to malware</a> apps.</p>
<p>After hearing the feedback from users and developers, Google has <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-developer-verification-early.html" data-wpel-link="external">updated its policy,</a> to announce that it will allow experienced users to install apps from third-party sources. The updated statement mentions that it is "building a new advanced flow that allows experienced users to accept the risks of installing software that isn't verified." This flow is designed to resist coercion, and to prevent users from bypassing safety checks while under pressure from a scammer. It will also involve clear warnings that explain the risks involved.</p>
<p>This sounds similar to the system that Xiaomi has on its phones in HyperOS, and formerly on MIUI. When you try to install an APK downloaded from the internet, it displays a warning screen that tells you about the security risks, and makes you wait for about 10 seconds, before letting you accept the risks and install the app. It's a bit annoying, but at least it doesn't block the installation.</p>
<p>While this is good news for power users, chances are Google could come back with a different plan in the future. But there is something else that may allow more freedom for Android users.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Epic and Google revealed that they are working on a settlement in their 5-year-long lawsuit. Google had lost the antitrust case which began in 2020, after a court deemed it guilty of building <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2023/12/12/google-has-illegal-app-store-monopoly-says-jury-in-epic-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">an illegal monopoly on Android</a>, specifically by not allowing third party payment options and app distribution through the Google Play Store. However, the case has dragged on because of a ruling that <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2024/10/08/court-orders-google-to-lift-restrictions-on-play-store-after-epic-games-antitrust-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">opened up the Play Store</a> to allow third party payment methods, and also host alternate app marketplaces for three years. These rules were only applicable in the U.S., not worldwide.</p>
<p>Google had appealed against the changes, but <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/08/01/google-loses-its-appeal-against-epic-games/" data-wpel-link="internal">failed to win the appeal</a>, and was <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/10/31/google-opens-up-play-store-to-allow-third-party-payment-methods-in-the-u-s/" data-wpel-link="internal">forced to make changes to its Play Store policies</a> to comply with the law. Now, Google and Epic have reached an agreement where Google has offered to lower the Play Store service fee from 30% to 9% or 20% based on the transaction, which could mean lower prices for users. Google will also allow alternative marketplaces on the Play Store. These changes are applicable around the world, until June 2032. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/813991/epic-google-proposed-settlement" data-wpel-link="external">The Verge</a> reported that the proposed settlement needs to be approved by U.S. District Court Judge, James Donato.</p>
<p>The result of this settlement may have a big impact on app distribution by keeping Android as an open ecosystem, as does Google's updated policy.</p>

			<title>Disney's channels are back on YouTube TV after a 2-week blackout</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The feud between YouTube TV and Disney has ended. Disney's channels are back on the streaming service after a blackout of over 2 weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/11/03/youtube-tv-loses-access-to-disney-espn-and-more/" data-wpel-link="internal">YouTube TV subscribers had lost access to Disney, ESPN, ABC</a>, and more, after a contract between YouTube TV and Disney expired on October 30th. Things got pretty dirty between the two companies, as they engaged in a game of blame publicly, where they claimed the other party was being stubborn. This resulted in over 10 million YouTube TV subscribers losing access to sporting events like Monday Night Football, and other programming.</p>
<p>YouTube for its part alleged that Disney had threatened to black out its services in a bid to force its hand in a deal that would make the service more expensive for users. In case you don't know, YouTube TV costs $82 per month. On the other hand, Disney claimed that YouTube was trying to abuse its dominant position, to undercut industry standard terms. As the spat between the two continued, a memo signed by three Disney's executives was leaked.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6787572/2025/11/07/espn-disney-memo-youtubetv-nfl/" data-wpel-link="external">The NY Times</a> reported that The Athletic had read the memo. The document had said that Disney had offered YouTube fair terms that were in line with over 500 distributors, including some that were bigger than YouTube TV. It also said that YouTube TV was unwilling to accept these terms, and insisted on receiving preferential terms. YouTube hit back at this, saying Disney had leaked documents to the press, and was using its network presenters to negotiate in public, and also that it had misrepresented the facts.</p>
<p>Even as the drama continued last week, <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2025/11/10/youtube-tv-is-issuing-a-20-credit-to-subscribers-after-losing-access-to-espn-disney/" data-wpel-link="internal">YouTube TV issued a one-time credit of $20</a> that subscribers could avail. But, things have taken a surprising turn. Google and Disney have finally come to an agreement. YouTube has <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/disney-youtube-tv/" data-wpel-link="external">updated its statement</a> to say Disney's channels are now back on YouTube TV, and has apologized to subscribers for the disruption. The Walt Disney Company also published <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-announces-multi-year-distribution-agreement-with-youtube-tv/" data-wpel-link="external">a statement on its website</a> to say it has reached a multi-year distribution agreement with YouTube TV, and that Disney's channels including ESPN, ABC, Freeform, FX, the National Geographic channels are all available for YouTube TV subscribers.</p>

			<title>I Was Going To Be A Pen Nerd</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>So, I wrote in one of my link posts that I had decided to buy a Platinum Preppy fountain pen. I’ve now done that, and I have to say, I love it. I’ll do a full review of it soon, but I am a convert. So much so, that I hopped on Amazon and bought myself some more fountain pens. I found this multi-pack with loads of colors called Eyeye Pen. It has 10 colors for about 15 bucks, I think, and those too are really good.</p>
<p>So, I have all these fountain pens, and I’m like: “I’m a pen nerd now!”</p>

<figcaption>The Pen Addict Podcast</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And what does a real pen nerd do? They listen to an hour long podcast about pens, of course! What else would they do? Thanks to a few of my blogging buddies, I found <a href="https://www.relay.fm/penaddict">The Pen Addict</a>. It’s a great podcast all about pens and paper and stationary. Now that I’m a pen nerd, I feel right at home.</p>
<p>Or at least, I did for a while. Then they started talking about their favorite pens, and the prices that are attached to them. Hey, did you know that pens can be really cheap, but if you’re a pen nerd, they’re actually REALLY FUCKING EXPENSIVE? Yeah, me neither.</p>
<p>When they started talking about “mid range” pens being in the $250 range, I was shocked. And then they were talking about $1000 pens, and $25,000 pens. The fuck?</p>
<p>So, I <em>was going to be</em> a pen nerd. I think I might be a cheap pen nerd. And I mean really cheap. I’ll pay $30 for <strong>a pack of pens</strong>. That doesn’t sound so bad. But they better be good pens, or it’s not a great buy. If I ever write a blog post for you guys where I even <em>talk</em> about spending a lot of money on a pen, somebody please contact the authorities as I’ve obviously had some sort of mental breakdown.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I threw my back out this weekend, and not even for a good reason. I wasn’t dancing, hauling furniture, or rescuing kittens from a burning building. Or… you know. <em>That</em> might’ve been worth it. No, I was <em>cleaning.</em> Cleaning! Truly the least sexy origin story imaginable.</p>
<p>A nap would never betray me like this.</p>

			<title>The thing that libs don't realize about means testing</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>...is that it is insanely annoying!!</p>
<p>I am now signed up for unemployment insurance in the state of California. I spent a lot of time on the phone recently trying to submit and the correct my application for it. This is the first time I have been laid off in my life (I had a 15 year streak of dodging layoffs by leaving for a new job immediately before they occurred!) and therefore this is the first time I have been eligible for UI in any part of the US.</p>
<p>I've been against aggressive means-testing for a long time because it seems stupid, unfair, and a waste of energy to restrict our social safety net programs with massive bureaucratic surveillance programs. I knew from my friends that it is also unbelievably annoying; I now have that experience myself. It is actually more annoying than doing my taxes, which is crazy. (I'd assumed that it would be about <em>exactly</em> as annoying as doing my taxes.)</p>
<p>The forms are huge, the websites are oddly laid-out, and everything is written in the strangest, densest language possible. The phone trees are word puzzles - every verbal question they pose will have multiple long asides referring to possible exceptions, often listing out specific document names or federal programs. By the time the phone tree completes a question, I sometimes have a hard time remembering how the sentence began.</p>
<p>I had the experience of being manually marked as "unable or unwilling to work full time", which I needed to call and correct; the guy at the EDD office had no idea why I'd been marked that way and simply manually reversed it. This is when I learned that my ability or willingness to work within the CA unemployment insurance system is not something that I can attest to positively <em>myself,</em> as <em>the worker in question;</em> it's something that a stranger at the back of the EDD tech decides about me and <em>manually inputs</em> after reviewing my material.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was on the phone solving that and other problems for hours. Amazing!</p>
<p>That's the whole blog post today: means testing is <em>more</em> annoying than doing your taxes. In my experience, it was about exactly as annoying as getting challenged by health insurance. On a stress level, it is even comparable to the time that airport security tried to take all my diabetes equipment away from me, which was possibly the most terrifying and morally objectionable bureaucratic challenge I've navigated in my life. (I was, I think, sixteen.) That's it! That's the post!!</p>]]></description>
