                    <p data-sanitized-class="mb-4"> hi everyone! long time no see! i just want to provide a small update! :)<br>
i've been trying to grow out mint at home! ٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و ♡<br>
<br>
about a week ago, I was on a walk, and found wild mint growing from the ground, and so I've decided to take a sproutling for myself, to try and grow it out at home, because, why not? am i right?<br>
it took about 11 days for roots to get long enough for me to be able to plant it! not too long, right!<br>
<br>
after 3 days of her being home with me, i had baby roots!<br>

weren't they so cute!?<br>
<br>
now after two more days, we had bigger roots ^___^<br>

and after five more days I had a got full root system with even a baby plant next to it! (this was yesterday)<br>
<img src="https://riri.my/img/IMG_20250917_133317.jpg" alt="5 days later"><br>
i've decided to give it another day in the water cup so it can spread its roots a tad bit more, and today I've decided to plant it :)<br>

<br>
while i'm not a tea drinker (usually) i just wanted a small plant to take care of! i hope she grows biiiiiiiiiig.<br>
