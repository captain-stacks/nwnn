                    <h3 data-sanitized-class="widget-subtitle">november 27, 2025 @ 04:53 pm | est. reading time: 9 - 10 mins | word count 1732</h3><br>
                     <h2 data-sanitized-class="widget-title">no! personal web isn’t dead, you’re just stupid</h2>
                    <p data-sanitized-class="mb-4"> there’s nothing i fucking hate more than know-it-alls that pretend personal web is dead. because it isn’t. sure, it’s niche and not mainstream but doesn’t mean its dead. but “personal websites are dead” is the exact take id expect from someone publishing their shit on medium. yay! u linked your domain to a centralized soulless service how clever of you! you go!!<br>
this post is a re: to “<a href="https://archive.md/l9dfs">The End of Personal Websites - And why it may be a good thing</a>”. spoiler alert: it is <b>not</b> a good thing. also Why The Fuck Are You Titling It Like This?<br>
and so you have the audacity to say<br>
    <br>
        Personal websites used to be awesome. Your own URL. Your own layout. Your own playground. Design freedom.<br>
    <br>
you betrayed us, you betrayed everyone. if you truly believed in “your own playground”, you would’ve stayed. but instead, you’ve decided to chase after corporate entities, because i guess it’s easier for you, huh?<br>
    <br>
        For a long time, it felt like my own website was a form of digital independence.<br>
    <br>
it still would’ve been like that for you, if only you had a spine. but i guess it’s easier to be a cuck to some corporate entity, letting them take care after your website. you aren’t a webmaster, you’re a pussy. <br>
    <br>
        Most creators don’t have personal websites anymore. Or if they do, it’s a short bio and the last three links.<br>
    <br>
you’re part of the problem. because of spineless idiots like you, and shit takes like yours, a lot of people are AFRAID to have their own platform(s). we live in a society where being perceived as “cringe” is faux pas, and most want to avoid that. meanwhile i’m pretty sure many of those same people with “a short bio” would have full fledged websites if fuckers like you wouldn’t look down at them!<br>
    <br>
        We moved. We migrated. We outsourced our digital homes to platforms that promised reach, ease of use, discoverability, community, monetization, and speed.<br>
    <br>
you mean, YOU moved and a handful of techbros from your circle? anyone who’s actually passionate about the web, stayed exactly where you once were. you call it “outsorcing” i call it digital rent. you don’t truly own your space, when it’s not running your own code. while doing shit on your own is cutting edge, and never fully prod-ready, it gives you more freedom than anything premade ever will. a website you’d call your own doesn’t need to be fully prod. and that’s the hill id die on. idfc<br>
you think you need your medium bullshit page to be discovered? that’s truly kinda cute lol. in the last month alone my website had 815 vistors, 1.07k total visits, and 2.7k page views. this you’d hopefully agree, not bad at all.<br>
<img src="https://riri.my/img/post_media_692870e7e88db.png" alt="no! personal web isn’t dead, you’re just stupid  media" data-sanitized-class="img-frame mb-4 md:mb-0"><br>
the decline of personal websites isn’t inevitable but a concious choice people like you made.     <br>
        Personal websites are not dead, but they’re increasingly replaced by tools that come with a “website”.<br>
    <br>
oh, a “website”? even YOU are aware those arent real fucking sites? you love contradicting yourself, don’t you now!? so is your medium bullshit a website, or not? decide already lol.<br>
    <br>
        And maybe that’s not a tragedy. It’s progress.<br>
    <br>
chatgpt ahh sentence. and no it’s not progress, it’s quite literally a retrogress. i don’t want another fully white or fully black website with minimal design? where is the fucking soul of it? because of “standards” idiots like you follow, the web feels more hollow than it ever did! are you proud of yourself?<br>
    <br>
        Back in the 2000s and early 2010s, a personal website was your identity. I loved having my own site.<br>
It was the place I sent people. My long-term resume. My homepage. My blog. My store. Everything…<br>
    <br>
and yet you replaced it with a soulless entity like medium. the moment it became “easier”, huh? you say yourself that having your own site meant you controlled the space with your own rules, but you gave that the fuck away, so now medium can set rules? from an owner you became renter. and you’re fucking okay with thay? are you serious? are you like serius-serious? you say that owning the space also meant owning the maintenance, like that isn’t half the charm of personal web? If you see it as a chore, here’s a thought, maybe you shouldn’t fucking have a website in the first place? do you truly fucking think anyone gives a shit about your fucking, stupid little medium page, that looks exactly the same like every other fucking, stupid, little medium page? there is absolutely NO personality. the lack of customizability is laughable. and yet, somehow, you’re okay with it? are you stupid!?<br>
    <br>
Then something changed. Platforms started doing everything better than personal websites.<br>
    <br>
no, it’s not better, just way easier for lazy “webmasters” like yourself. you don’t want a website, you want fame. you want people to click your shit. you want views. they feed your ego. you see a website the exact same as social media page, while they were never fucking meant to be the same.<br>
<br>
People stopped typing URLs. Entirely. No one goes to “juliawrites.com” anymore. They go to TikTok. Or Substack. Or Medium. Or Twitter. Or anything that has a feed and an algorithm.<br>
<br>
tiktok or twitter, sure. i’m on there too. but one makes concious decision to go on substack or medium. also i find it weird that your name is burk, but your example was juliawrites lol. and for your information, people actually type in riri.my into their address bar. its easy to remember. if no one types your URL, you’re either not memorable or have a complicated url, both of which is a YOU problem anyways. and oh “people search, not type in” yeah my website is on google too, you don’t need medium or substack or whatever the fuck else you want to use for your “website”. just admit you’re lazy and go lmfao.<br>
<img src="https://riri.my/img/post_media_6928710c8a895.png" alt="no! personal web isn’t dead, you’re just stupid  media" data-sanitized-class="img-frame mb-4 md:mb-0"><br>
you call them platforms and services that made it easier, i call it enshittification. its not better, just easier. easier!== better.<br>
“Readers don’t browse homepages” you don’t. people still do. you also talk about how seo is weird and hard how websites arent discoverable by default. hmm ever heard of this little thing called webring. people who actually care about personal web, brought them back from the dead! that’s pretty neat isn’t it. but someone like you likely would never use such thing anyways. so mentioning them is likely futile. you’re very unlikely to even read this response and that’s okay i guess. but i wish you could realize how fucking wrong you are.<br>
<br>
Audiences want clean, simple interfaces<br>
Readers like consistency.<br>
They like familiarity.<br>
They like knowing where the buttons are.<br>
A personal site forces them to learn your design quirks. A platform gives them a predictable experience.<br>
<br>
yeah, people get used to what you call “design quirks”, or whatever eventually. what actually pisses most people off is that almost every website looks like copy-paste of another. people actually hate this. everyone outside your stupid fucking little bubble hares this. and maybe one day you’ll realize that. but you probably wont. also somewhere in your post you said how “AI tools filled in the gaps”. no one wants yo read ai generated articles. the moment someone gets the vibes it’s ai writting, they will leave, and never visit again. but you do you i guess.<br>
i genuinely can’t understand what exactly are you getting from dickriding big ass corporations that don’t give a single shit abuut you? you say “Some freedom disappears. We surrender design control. We trust platforms. We risk platform changes.” this 👏🏻 is 👏🏻 a 👏🏻 fucking 👏🏻 problem. you SHOULDN’T surrender your freedoms. not now, not in the past and not in the future. own your shit. host your shit. it’d be much better that way. but that will never get through your thick skull. <br>
“Publishing on a personal site is a very long game.” that’s the point?? what? i don’t understand why the fuck are you stating this as a negative when it isn’t. “Publishing on Substack is simpler. And quicker. Publishing on Medium even more.” it feels like the point of your whole fucking blogpost is to glaze and suckoff medium. how much are they paying you for this, huh? Is it fucking worth it? <br>
<br>
Your Substack profile is a website.<br>
Your Medium profile is a website.<br>
Your Gumroad shop is a website.<br>
Your Link-in-bio is a website.<br>
well yes, but actually no.<br>
“The idea of “my own URL” isn’t gone. But we’ve moved to other places.” correction: YOU have moved and made a fucking mistake, you’re too proud to admit, so now you’re stuck glazing over medium lol. you say in your blog to never depend on one platform, yet you clearly depend on medium... that’s actually cute. that you think you’re still independent. you’re not. you’re medium’s bitch. you’re their mutt. and if medium shits down, you’ll be SOL, unless you’ve kept backups.<br>
also, you say “People follow personality”, that means someone would follow you even on a fully self-made website, if you actually belived in your word. but you really don’t and its apparant.<br>
<br>
But for most creators, a personal website is becoming like a landline phone. It exists. Some people still use it. But nobody needs it to function.<br>
<br>
shit comparison. you’ve never needed a website to function. if you were a blogger back than, even back then it was because it was your hobby, bot because you “need” it. but then again i guess you see it differently. but you are wrong.<br>
<br>
Publishing moved from handcrafted homepages to ecosystems with reach, community, monetization, and built-in attention.<br>
<br>
ooooh “monetization” that’s the catch. i should’ve known from the start. but once you write for money, is it really a hobby anymroe? If you get money from it, you’d feel obligated to write more than you necessarily feel comfortable writting, and eventually you’ll just burn yourself out. but it’s not like you care, you’re only chasing after bag.<br>
“And this shift frees us from maintenance, boosts distribution, and lets our writing live where readers actually are.” yeah it lives where you don’t control it, even at the slightest. but sure, personal websites are useless. let’s just give our shit to big ass corpos, that’s totally a great idea.<br>
to conclude: personal web isn’t dead, this guy is just incredibly stupid.<br>
<br>

			<title>Mass mess</title>
			<link>https://robertbirming.com/mass-mess/</link>
						<dc:creator>birming</dc:creator>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I did six house inspections yesterday. The smallest was a shabby little 40-square-meter cabin from the 70’s. The biggest was a fancy 245-square-meter villa built this year.</p>
<p>All the clients had one thing in common. They all excused themselves for the mess.</p>
<p>Not because of some strange cosmic joke that made every house I visited yesterday messy. And not because it’s a Swedish thing to apologize for the mess, no matter how clean your home is.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>It’s because everybody really does think their home is the worst. They imagine all the houses I visit to be neat and spotless, and theirs is terrible in comparison.</p>
<p>But it’s not. It’s pretty much the same everywhere, no matter what area I’m working in or who happens to live there.</p>
<p>We people are more alike than we think.</p>
<p>So the next time you feel like your life is a mess compared to others, trust me when I say your neighbor’s the same.</p>
<p>You’re doing fine. Don’t worry.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Build Your Theories</title>
			<link>https://nikhil.bearblog.dev/build-your-theories/</link>
						<dc:creator>nikhil</dc:creator>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>We live in an age of abundant knowledge. No subject remains taboo in the era of artificial intelligence—they haven't been since the dawn of the internet, really. You can access information on virtually any topic: from history to metaphysics, from physics to parapsychology. These days, you can even locate experts in the most obscure domains. But what are we meant to do with all this information?</p>
<p>The more we know, the more we realize we don't know. We attempt to resolve this paradox by absorbing more knowledge into our lives. And by knowledge, I mean information we accumulate in our minds. Yet true knowledge cannot merely be information hoarding—our brains weren't designed for that. Still, the entire world aspires to become polymaths, and herein lies the crux of the issue.</p>
<p>We're meant to decode knowledge in our own manner, forming our own theories about the world. Those who become experts in a field typically begin with a destination in mind. They chart the path, acquire the knowledge, decode it until they've internalized the information, then dive deeper to learn more. This is the only progression our minds naturally understand. That's precisely why Feynman's technique resonates so powerfully—it enables exactly this process.</p>
<p>We must acquire knowledge to construct our own internal framework, forming a worldview we can then leverage to gain further knowledge and skills—developing that unique personality, that distinctive wisdom for which we pursued knowledge in the first place. In the age of artificial intelligence, the only differentiator is what you do with information; the internet democratized access to it, and AI has rendered mere possession of it redundant.</p>
<p>In a few prompts, AI can explain Egyptian culture to you. But someone who has built an internal knowledge framework—a mental architecture—can connect disparate dots and explain how the civil war in Rome virtually sealed Egypt's collapse. Such a worldview may be opinionated, but that is the beauty of being human. We acquire knowledge to understand the world and wield that understanding to our advantage.</p>
<p>Why must we form such theories anyway? To expand our thinking. Formulating any hypothesis creates a launchpad for new ideas, new pathways to discover, new perspectives to explore. That's exactly how innovation begins. You draw upon existing knowledge, apply mental models like first-principle thinking, and formulate groundbreaking hypotheses that advance civilization.</p>
<p>As humans, our duty isn't to hoard but to conquer new horizons. We are builders, innovators, conquerors. The purpose of humanity is exploration, and for that, you need knowledge—but more importantly, you need to build theories.</p>]]></description>

  <p>I’ve come to realize that statements about the future aren’t predictions: they’re more like spells. When someone describes <code>something</code> to you as the future, they’re sharing a heartfelt belief that this <code>something</code> will be part of whatever comes next. “Artificial intelligence isn’t going anywhere” quite literally involves casting a technology forward into time. How could that be anything else <em>but</em> a kind of magic?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The earliest book I remember reading is a picture book that I think my father bought (or was it a gift, a giveaway?) from his office in New Delhi. I remember only the brown paper packaging–a thin envelope, the kind in which you often get snacks packed from an expensive bakery–and the shade of purple that was used to depict the night sky. It was a Marathi folk story in which an old woman tricks a fox into landing on a hot pan on his bottom because he’d been stealing her bora (jujubes).<sup data-fn="731c7ccc-9cb7-461e-9e2c-57ddf7b6b65b" data-sanitized-class="fn"><a href="https://chavanniclass.wordpress.com/2025/11/27/picture-books-encyclopedias/#731c7ccc-9cb7-461e-9e2c-57ddf7b6b65b" data-sanitized-id="731c7ccc-9cb7-461e-9e2c-57ddf7b6b65b-link">1</a></sup> My grandmother used to tell me this story in a sing-song voice:</p>



<blockquote data-sanitized-class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>कोल्होबा, कोल्होबा, बोरं पिकली?<br>नाही, नाही, म्हातारी. टेरी शेकली!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another book I remember from around the same time (or perhaps a little later?) was a picture book I read in our school library, picked from a selection of other picture books offered to us second (or was it first?) graders, seated at one of the high, long tables. It was about a bird who didn’t spare a worm and later got trapped in a hunter’s nest. The moral of the story was that you sow what you reap or if you do bad things, bad things happen to you. I now wonder why it was bad for the bird to eat what it’s supposed to eat. </p>



<p>I’ve also wondered several times over the years about the fact that for women who grew up in homes where reading was an everyday part of life, neither my mother nor my grandmother bought books for me. </p>



<p>The only purchase I can recall is an encyclopedia that my mother had bought from a door-to-door salesman in Nagpur, when I might have been in Class 3. It had an ochre cover and glossy pages. It was divided into several sections, which one could sort through by the color of the edges. There were pages devoted to, among other topics that I can’t recall, the body (which I mostly avoided because I thought eye diagrams were boring), to the natural world, to the modern world, to space (I think) and to History.</p>



<p>The latter was my favorite. I was especially fond of a spread page featuring an illustration of some houses built next to each other which had “doors” on the roof–square holes in the ceilings through which people went in and out using ladders.<sup data-fn="764e4298-cb94-4d7b-a48c-c78f2474559a" data-sanitized-class="fn"><a href="https://chavanniclass.wordpress.com/2025/11/27/picture-books-encyclopedias/#764e4298-cb94-4d7b-a48c-c78f2474559a" data-sanitized-id="764e4298-cb94-4d7b-a48c-c78f2474559a-link">2</a></sup> The walls were smooth and white and a couple of women, cloth wrapped around their bodies and hair knotted in buns, stood chatting outside one of the houses. I was fascinated by this lack of doors on the ground. How fun might it have been to have such easy access to roofs! What if you had to carry a load as you climbed? What about old people whose knees hurt?</p>



<p>What must it be like to live in a particular time far in the past is a question that still excites me; even now when I visit historical places or walk through cities and spot old houses, I wonder what they would have looked like when they’d just been made, new and colorful and not yet marked with the residue of daily inhabitation, like scratches and stains. </p>



<p>I can recall myself paging through the encyclopedia in our little bedroom, lying on my stomach, rereading the History section, skipping the section on the body and machines (I’ve since fell in the love with the former). I loved that book and I don’t know why I gave it away (if that’s what I did) to the <em>kabadiwala</em>. I think it was falling apart. </p>



<p>Wikipedia and the online version of Encyclopedia Britannica replaced that book as I grew up. Recently, though, as AI is infecting everything and I’m more stubbornly appreciating everything analog, I’ve been spending time pulling out random editions of encyclopedias new and old from the shelves of our college library, just to feel the heft of those reference books in my hand. I’ve thought of getting the <em><a href="https://www.worldbook.com/">World Book Encyclopedia</a></em> after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/06/rejoice-its-2023-and-you-can-still-buy-a-22-volume-paper-encyclopedia/">reading an article about it</a>, even though it’s way beyond my means and would probably be USAmerica-centric. Sometimes, I dream of returning to Daryaganj, the second-hand book market in New Delhi, and lugging home large encyclopedias just because I don’t want them to go unappreciated and can be content in owning some of them, sifting through them randomly for some fun facts or stories I could then tell everyone in my book club about. </p>



<p>Someday. Someday, I <em>will</em> have an encyclopedia in my bookshelf. </p>

  <p>React is no longer just a library. It’s a full ecosystem that defines how frontend developers are allowed to think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22265">Real talk</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Browsers now ship View Transitions, Container Queries, and smarter scheduling primitives. The platform keeps evolving at a fair pace, but most teams won’t touch these capabilities until React officially wraps them in a hook or they show up in Next.js docs.</p>
  
  <p>Innovation keeps happening right across the ecosystem, but for many it only becomes “real” once React validates the approach. Which is fine, assuming you enjoy waiting for permission to use the platform you’re already building on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zing!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The critique isn’t that React is bad, but that treating any single framework as infrastructure creates blind spots in how we think and build. When React becomes the lens through which we see the web, we stop noticing what the platform itself can already do, and we stop reaching for native solutions because we’re waiting for the framework-approved version to show up first.</p>
  
  <p>If your team’s evolution depends on a single framework’s roadmap, you are not steering your product; you are waiting for permission to move.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2024_11_24.html#018777">link-to-the-link-to-the-etc</a>.  (Locating last year's post was a little harrowing, because the election was so fresh.  We were in such collective shocked rage and grief.  Of course we still are, but the shock has worn off.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope you all have a restful day with some good food.  I'm off to run a little turkey trot, and I'm hoping to finish the 5K before Pokey finishes the 10K. </p>]]></description>
