			<description><![CDATA[<p>I don’t even know what I did this week as I sit down to write this post. Thankfully, I have some daily notes to check out. It has been a really, really long week.</p>
<h1 data-sanitized-id="work">Work</h1>
<p>Meh. That’s all I have to say about that shit. Almost done. Writer’s final articles are in. The editing will be done during the next two weeks, and then they go to design and media. And then after that’s done they’ll come back to me for my final approval, and then I’ll be done.</p>
<p>Still hasn’t quite sunk in that I’ll be unemployed in just a few weeks.</p>
<h1 data-sanitized-id="programming">Programming</h1>
<img src="https://mtwb.blog/assets/homepage.png" alt="My new homepage" data-sanitized-class="left">
<p>I made a homepage this week. It is pretty cool. I will admit that Claude did a lot of heavy lifting with the react code, as I don’t know much about it. I did the HTML and CSS stuff, though, so I get some credit.</p>
<p>I worked a bit more on my iTunes replacement, but I’m in a lull at the moment. Still not ready to share it.</p>
<p>Oh, and I set up <a href="https://mtwb.blog/posts/2025/fediverse-comments/">Fediverse comments</a> on this here blog! I’m pretty proud of that. You can see them below, leave one! It’s fun.</p>
<h1 data-sanitized-id="blogging">Blogging</h1>
<p>My most popular blog post of the week was yesterday’s about <a href="https://mtwb.blog/posts/2025/i-was-going-to-be-a-pen-nerd/">being a pen nerd</a>. I think some people were quite shocked like I was about the price of pens. Others, you crazy fools, already knew all about it.</p>
<h1 data-sanitized-id="potpourri">Potpourri</h1>
<ul>
<li>I did okay posting on TLC this week, but I didn’t get a short up. Hoping to get one up tonight.</li>
<li>I hurt my knee a couple days ago, so it has been rough as sitting for a long period of time means that getting up is damn near impossible. I’m working through it though. Nothing really knew, I’ve had knee problems since high school.</li>
<li>I finished the base set of my rebuilt music library this week. Almost 40,000 tracks. The initial metadata import into Jellyfin wasn’t great, but after some config file edits, I got it there. It is way better than it was before, but still not perfect. I think it’s going to take years to get it there, but it’s much more usable now.</li>
<li>I ended up having to replace my Dactyl. The problem I’ve been talking about for a couple weeks was way worse than I thought. The designer of this particular print did not use pcb, but instead a series of ribbon cables. One of these somehow became frayed, and that’s what was causing my issues. I was just a few months outside of the warranty, which sucks. I’ll take better care of the next one. If I had a 3D printer or any soldering skills whatsoever, I’d make one myself.</li>
<li>This was last week, but I traded my nephew some gaming stuff for a Pixel 10 Pro Fold. He got it a few weeks ago and hated it, and he wanted some of my Xbox stuff, so we traded. I’ll have a full write up on it eventually, but so far my verdict is: meh. I see why he didn’t like it.</li>
<li>I am still on Hyprland. I’m thinking now I’ll wait until NixOS 25.11 comes out and do a reinstall. My hope is that the update will fix a lot of my issues with Plasma, and hopefully DaVinci Resolve.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-sanitized-id="small-web-links">Small Web Links</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://afranca.com.br/small-web-big-voice">afranca</a> talks about how awesome the small web is. Couldn’t agree more.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thisdaysportion.com/posts/static-sites-killed-comments/">Leon</a> talks about commenting on today’s web. I’m a big fan of comments, and I don’t think they’re dead at all. They’re just hard to implement. The small web, like Leon says, has a chance to make that situation better.</li>
<li><a href="https://so1o.xyz/blog/incompetence">High tech, but incompetence</a> is all about going outdoors. I need to follow this advice more.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-sanitized-id="last-weeks-goals">Last Week’s Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Finish <em>Priory of the Orange Tree</em> ✖️ (but I did make progress, over the 25% mark now).</li>
<li>Finish Downloading main music library ✅</li>
<li>Stick to new video schedule for TLC - Kinda, but not really ✖️</li>
<li>Clean My Desk ✖️</li>
<li>Try DankShell ✖️</li>
<li>Fix Plasma or Gnome ✖️</li>
<li>Rewrite Emoji Script to remember last used emojis ✖️</li>
</ul>
<p>Goodness, that was bad.</p>
<h1 data-sanitized-id="goals-for-this-week">Goals For This Week</h1>
<ul>
<li>Keep working on <em>Priory</em></li>
<li>Re-Download my country music library and work on the metadata</li>
<li>Clean the effing desk.</li>
<li>Do a better job of pushing videos to TLC as per my new schedule.</li>
<li>Do at least one video for Historic Alley, or a blog post.</li>
<li>Try DankShell</li>
<li>Write emoji script.</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I came across this striking conundrum of aura in, ironically, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Walter_Benjamin_vers_1928.jpg">a photograph of Walter Benjamin</a>, who developed <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/12/read-the-work-of-art-in-the-age-of-mechanical-reproduction/">the concept of aura in art</a>. Aura is, in Benjamin’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[a work of art’s] presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in physical condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownership.”</p></blockquote>
<p>On Wikimedia, there are two versions of his portrait: a scan of his passport photo, and a touched up version that removes physical damage from the original.</p>
<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31737" data-sanitized-id="attachment_31737" data-sanitized-class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://tracydurnell.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/walter-benjamin-passport-photo-original.jpg" alt="passport photograph of Walter Benjamin, blue-tinted, scuffed and punched through by two holes, ink speared over his forehead, creased and wrinkled, with a stamp overlapping the frame" width="779" height="935" data-sanitized-class="wp-image-31737 size-full"><figcaption data-sanitized-id="caption-attachment-31737" data-sanitized-class="wp-caption-text">Walter Benjamin’s passport photo</figcaption></figure>
<p><span data-sanitized-id="more-31736"></span></p>
<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31738" data-sanitized-id="attachment_31738" data-sanitized-class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://tracydurnell.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/walter-benjamin-edited.jpg" alt="Walter Benjamin passport photo, cleaned up and retouched to remove physical damage and retoned to black and white, with a blank background and his back arm entirely created in the edit (since it was originally fully obscured)" width="750" height="907" data-sanitized-class="wp-image-31738 size-full"><figcaption data-sanitized-id="caption-attachment-31738" data-sanitized-class="wp-caption-text">retouched photo of Walter Benjamin</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Which of these versions is more authentic? Which conveys the photograph’s aura?</strong></p>
<p>The original passport photo is loaded with the aura of use, brads punched through, ink smeared on the photo, a stamp across its edge. <strong>The touched-up version is a modern attempt to recreate the original portrait as it would have been before being affixed to the passport; it allows us to see Benjamin without the distraction of the damage on the passport scan… does that make it more authentic?</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300205718/what-art-is/"><em>What Art Is</em></a>, Arthur C. Danto devotes an entire chapter to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoration_of_the_Sistine_Chapel_frescoes">cleaning of the Sistine Chapel</a>. He posits that the accumulated smoke and grime of centuries that had accumulated on the ceiling, which rendered the paintings nearly tonal and obscured the bright colors originally used, was part of the artwork’s aura. I can buy this argument because the art is inextricable from its setting; it was made to be a ceiling decoration of a living building — an <em>old </em>building belonging to an ancient institution. I can’t say the smoke accumulation was *intended,* but as a piece of functional art, it could be anticipated… and potentially accommodated. Cleaning the art detaches it from the building’s longevity — from <em>its own</em> longevity — pretending that it is new, untouched by the ages. It artificially removes it from its place in the world and time.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin would almost certainly say the scanned passport is what is most authentic. At that time, the print attached to the passport was likely the only copy, thus its placement reflects its purpose and passage through time, and the damage is part of the portrait’s aura.</strong> My inclination is that I would rather see the scan, which carries the weight of his lived history and makes me think of his fateful flight from the Nazis.</p>
<p>The retouched version seems “fake” to me now that I know what the scanned artifact looked like. It appears that the retouched version supplants the scan across Wikipedia because it is considered a newer version of the same image; this use probably makes sense because people want to see what he looked like, and do not care about the aura of the artifact. But I do find it an intriguing irony, born of applying a digital mindset to a physical artifact — exactly what Benjamin was writing about.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://combatdavey.net/november-14-etc/">Friday I shared a thought</a> re: how I wanted to make stuff going forward.</p>
<p>The gist, if you didn't click through, is that I want to make the daily post a bit more writerly/freeform and push the linksy bits to a newsletter thinger that goes out once a week because the thing I always wanted to do was make a living being a guy who makes nice things for the internet and boy howdy I'm just going to fucking do it.</p>
<p>Anyway I thought about that thought, and the reasons behind it, and the reasons behind why I thought it was important to announce the thought and and and all damn weekend because I have never been guilty of underthinking anything. So, yeah, I am as self-obsessed as the next guy (if not more so) but it's because I actually put a lot of effort into doing these posts. I like them and I like people who read blogs (like you!) and moreover I making stuff for people who like stuff because it seems like no one likes stuff anymore.</p>
<p>I put a lot of effort into everything I love to do, actually. I always have. But because I've always loved to do a lot of things and grew up with that perfectionist mindset, there's always been a pain underneath that love.</p>
<p>For a while I thought the cure was loving things less (because I have a broken brain and thought the lesson was that the world desensitizes us over time, like water smoothing a rock over the course of millennia), but over time I realized it was the inverse —— that the cure is loving as many things as possible but doing fewer things with everything I have, and having more everything to give. As Jerry Maguire might say: "fewer clients, less money."</p>
<p>Anyway, the gist behind the gist is that the list of things I do with 100% of my whatever has gotten smaller as I've gotten older (and soberer, and healthier, and mellower, and happier) and that reducing has helped me understand something elementary and fundamental: love takes a lot out of a mf.</p>
<p>The colour wall at the top is all the colours that the Washington Wizards use in their uniforms, by the way. I was looking through hex codes for certain uniform colours the other day and found that one particularly soothing.</p>
<p>🌲 gonna <br>
🌼 go <br>
🌱 to <br>
🌳 sleep <br>
🌷 now</p>
<p>Be good to yourself.</p>

			<title>Bear Halloween Theme</title>

</figure>
<p>I made a Halloween-inspired theme for Bear last year. This time, I thought I’d just give it a small polish. Well, that didn’t quite happen... 😅</p>
<p>I ended up going all in again, just for the fun of it. So this year you’ll get a spooky cursor, glowing bits, an annoyingly restless bat, and a whole lot more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No tracking, just hauntingly simple blogging. <cite>Hauntman Morbidious</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feel free to use it however you like. Just copy the styles below, head to your theme settings, and paste them in.</p>
<p>Happy haunting! 👻</p>
<p><em>Update 29/10: 🦇 Fixed the moonwalking Michael Batson... it now flies in the right direction. Thanks <a href="https://grub.bearblog.dev/">Sylvia</a> for pointing it out!</em></p>

			<title>Learning to blog with doubt</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I’m in the process of moving my scattered blog posts into this “new” home of mine. Some of the oldest ones were written a few years ago.</p>
<p>I’ve never had a specific theme for my writing, even though it often tends to revolve around creativity and everyday experiences. While going through the old posts, I noticed one topic that kept coming back:</p>
<p>My blogging doubts.</p>
<p>There were doubts about writing in English, uncertainty about which platform to use, and even thoughts about quitting blogging altogether.</p>
<p>Seeing these recurring posts over a longer period of time made me realize something:</p>
<p>My doubts will never go away.</p>
<p>By now, I’ve tried everything to make them disappear. I’ve blogged in both Swedish and English, written often and rarely, long and short, tested just about every platform out there, and even quit completely — still, no change.</p>
<p>Seeing all this right before my eyes also made me realize something else:</p>
<p>It’s ok. It’s not the end of the world to live with blogging doubts. It’s only when I think those thoughts <em>shouldn’t be there</em> that it feels like a problem.</p>
<p>By simply accepting the doubts, the “problem” is gone.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I have spent the last few weeks living in Westwood. Near UCLA, you tend to see a lot of "delivery robots" - tiny square delivery vehicles which are ambiguously driven by people? <em>not</em> by people? through this part of the city to make food deliveries.</p>
<p>Here are some parked on the street. You will see that the one closest to the camera is also an advertisement for the TV show "Welcome To Derry."</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lauram/img_0860.webp" alt="IMG_0860"></p>
<p>Like a lot of companies, <a href="https://www.cocodelivery.com/coco">Coco,</a> the company that operates most of these machines, keeps it vague on whether these robots are joysticked directly by humans, and how often, and in what circumstances. Most of the people I know believe that these "robots" are joysticked from afar, directly by humans, nearly all of the time. I can't say that's for sure, but the marketing copy on the website is evasive enough that it's possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-End Neural Networks</p>
<p>Coco Robotics navigates dense urban environments by combining precision mapping, end-to-end neural networks, and human oversight. Its delivery vehicles are built to handle unpredictable terrain—like crowded sidewalks, uneven surfaces, and low-light conditions—common in cities like Los Angeles. With onboard cameras, LiDAR, and GPS, Coco’s robots can safely maneuver through complex pathways, delivering goods quickly and reliably while adapting to ever-changing street-level dynamics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, it implies that human intervention is needed infrequently, without really ever saying <em>for sure</em> how frequently or infrequently it's needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When human intervention is needed, the Pilot Terminal instantly delivers all relevant context—ETA, turn-by-turn navigation, obstruction alerts, a troubleshooting guide, and map annotation tools—for fast, informed decision-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of marketing language should be pretty familiar to you by now. It's the kind of language that very carefully avoids saying exactly what contribution humans are making, probably so that - if you desire - you can imagine that these robots are more autonomous than they really are. (Waymo has the same problem - those "self-driving" cars also have pretty heavy "human oversight.")</p>
<p>I am personally leaning towards "nearly continuously joysticked." They tend to navigate moving obstacles - humans, strollers, dogs, etc - in an aware, hesitant, almost <em>social</em> way that suggests to me there's a human consciousness "in" there, choosing how to share space with me on the sidewalk. I suppose it's possible that they drive themselves autonomously when no moving obstacles like humans are around, but in the places I see them most often, human interaction can be very nearly <em>continuous.</em> So I see these things nearly continuously negotiating with me for space on the sidewalk. In the presence of humans, they don't seem to have interpretable, manipulable heuristics of movement, or <em>repeated habits,</em> or anything that marks their movement as particularly "autonomous". They're just kind of navigating around me, differently every time, the way a person might roll an RC car around me.</p>
<p>But: this is just <em>my guess.</em> I have no proof to back up my belief that the ones I see around me in 2025 are continuously joysticked. There's something very interesting in the way the company's evasiveness about human oversight allows everyone who encounters these things to fill in the unexplained space with their own techno-optimism or cynicism. I'm certainly a cynic.</p>
<p>A few years ago, they were less evasive. <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/story/2023/06/27/robot-food-delivery-autonomy">This article from June 2023</a> says that they were human-driven at that time, and that the company had engineers <em>trying</em> to make them autonomous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human drivers are part of the Coco business model. Employees working from home pilot them through dense urban areas remotely, using Xbox controllers.</p>
<p>“We like people who are good at video games,” Rash said. “So our interview is a video game, we do training in simulators and video games. So it’s a lot of young gamers, and that’s a great demographic to tap into.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second company has somewhat larger and more expensive-looking delivery boxes in the neighborhood as well - <a href="https://www.serverobotics.com/">Serve Robotics.</a> These are more anthropomorphized, and they have a little screen on top which states their "name." This company's stance toward autonomy is even fuzzier - they say even fewer specific things - but their site links to <a href="https://www.voysys.se/">a completely different site</a> for a Swedish "teleoperation" company. So I feel even more confident in believing that these are joysticked.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the streetscape is made for cars, and then for humans. Joysticked or autonomous boxes on the street are in a distant third. They are not able to interact with beg buttons at crosswalks. A few weeks ago, I had a strange encounter with one that actually "noticed" me, did a k-turn to <em>face</em> me, then "asked" me to press the crosswalk button for it:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lauram/img_0808.webp" alt="IMG_0808"></p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/lauram/pushcrosswalk2.webp" alt="pushcrosswalk2"></p>
<p>That's a little screen saying "Push crosswalk button for me?"</p>
<p>I pushed it. The only reason I did is because I was so certain that a real human somewhere - someone with an absolutely abysmal teleoperation job delivering snacks to American college students in a tiny rolling box - needed me to make their day easier. If I believed it was an autonomous robot operated by a tech company, I think I would have tried to find a way to leave it completely fucking stranded.</p>]]></description>
